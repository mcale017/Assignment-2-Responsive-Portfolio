                My name is Ryan McAleese and I'm 25 years old. I'm currently attending the coding boot camp at the University of Minnesota and I've been enjoying every bit of it thus far. Funnily enough, I graduated from this same university as an undergraduate back in 2015 so it's pretty cool coming back. I've already met a lot of incredible people from the program and I look forward to keep working with them throughout the program.

                I enjoy playing and watching sports, mostly soccer, hockey and football; although the amount of time spent on actually playing has drastically gone down the last few years. I am unfortunately a fan of all Minnesota sports teams; it hurts to root for the Vikings and the Wild year in and year out. I also enjoy playing a lot of video games online with my friends; some of the games I play are Overwatch, Rocket League, League of Legends, Minecraft, PUBG and so on.
